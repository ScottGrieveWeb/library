This project is a simple library web app used to track books. The goal of this project is to put into practice what I have learnt in the JS pathway thus far.

Features that will be added further in my learning:
- Login functionality
- Scoring/Reviewing
- Improved UI
- Edit functionality
- Tracking/different libraries for different statuses (read/unread)
- Mobile responsiveness
